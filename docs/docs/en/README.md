## About this document

`Sipeed` has launched a series of `AI` development boards, including:
* `Maix-I(M1)` series of `MaixBit`, `Maixduino` `M1s-Dock` and other microcontroller development boards with hardware `AI` acceleration.
* Cost-effective `SOC` development boards with `AI` hardware acceleration, such as `M2-Dock` `MaixSense` of the `Maix-II(M2)` series.
* High-performance `SOC` development boards such as `M3 AX-Pi` of the `Maix-III(M3)` series.

In order to popularize the application of `AI` on edge devices, `Sipeed` has developed easy-to-use `MaixPy` and `MaixPy3` SDKs, and supplied [MaixHub](https://maixhub.com/) platform to make developers can easily train models without AI programming foundation and AI training experience.

On this basis, this document is dedicated to providing developers with an `AI` development guide, the purpose is to allow novices to quickly get started with `AI` applications, or developers who have mastered `AI` related knowledge to quickly apply the results to the device or on the product.
The content includes but is not limited to:
* Basic knowledge of AI
* Model training guide
* AI tutorial recommendation
* AI interesting project recommendation
* Commonly used tools
* Edge Device Deployment Guide
